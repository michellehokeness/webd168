      <h3>Reason for taking this course</h3>
       <p>I am taking WEBD168 because I love hard coding and want/need to get better at it. Another reason for taking this class is that it fills a requirement for the Web Development Program at Mesa Community College and I would like to complete that.</p>
       <p>Eventually, I hope to land a job in web development or design and start a new career. I will miss the relationships I have with my hair clients but I am ready to earn a living being creative in a different way.</p>

      <h3>Programs I have completed:</h3>
      <p>I started dabbling in Web Development in 2020 when I wasn't able to work in the salon due to Covid19. My son is a software engineer and thought I might enjoy it. He was right! It is a completely different way of being creative and I like being able to do it on a computer device as opposed to touching humans. It definitely was a nice change.</p>

  <h3>In My Leisure Time</h3>
  <p>Things I like to do in my leisure time are spending time with family, spending time with all my pets, watching movies on the big screen or in the comfort of my own home. I also love to run and compete against myself. There are always a variety of challenges to have fun with that help me improve my fitness - of mind and body.</p>
