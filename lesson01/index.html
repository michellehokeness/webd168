      <p>I am a mother. This picture on the left is of me with my son at Stone Brewery. I am also a wife to my second husband for almost 13 years. I am a daughter, a hair stylist, a web developer, a graphic designer and, most importantly, Jesus lives inside this heart of mine.</p>
      <p>I am taking WEBD168 because I love hard coding and want/need to get better at it. Another reason for taking this class is that it fills a requirement for the Web Development Program at Mesa Community College and I would like to complete that.</p>
      <p>I started dabbling in Web Development in 2020 when I wasn't able to work in the salon due to Covid19. My son is a software engineer and thought I might enjoy it. He was right! It is a completely different way of being creative and I like being able to do it on a computer device as opposed to touching humans. It definitely was a nice change.</p>
      <p>Programs I have completed:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>FEWD l & ll SD Continuing Ed</li>
        <li>Full Stack SD Continuing Ed</li>
        <li>Graphic Design SD Continuing Ed</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Things I like to do in my leisure time are spending time with family, spending time with all my pets, watching movies on the big screen or in the comport of my own home. I also love to run and compete against myself. There are always a variety of challenges to have fun with that help me improve my fitness - of mind and body.</p>

      <p>The picture below is a combination of 4 images of my cats and an image of the fushcia and orange flowers image with the graphic art I created using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
